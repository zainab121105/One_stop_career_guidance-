## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Configuration
```bash
# Verify API key is set
echo $GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY

# Test API connectivity
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Hello"}]}]}' \
     "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
```

#### Database Connection
```bash
# Check MongoDB connection
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/careerpath

# Verify collections
db.careeroadmaps.count()
db.users.count()
```

#### Cache Performance
```bash
# Check cache statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/roadmap/cache/stats
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- **Initial Generation**: 3-8 seconds (with AI)
- **Cached Retrieval**: 100-300ms
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 60-80% for similar profiles
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for 1000 cached roadmaps

### Optimization Tips
1. **Preload Popular Roadmaps**: Cache common profiles during low-traffic periods
2. **Profile Similarity**: Fine-tune similarity scoring for better cache hits
3. **Memory Management**: Adjust cache size based on server capacity
4. **API Rate Limits**: Implement queuing for high-volume generation
